 <!-- WE CAN WRITE COMPONENTS AS FOLLOWS

        1.)    <TheHeader></TheHeader>  - PascalCase Notation

        2.)  <the-header></the-header> - kebab-case

        3.) < TheHeader/> - SelfClosing        

      -HOWEVER SelfClosing  WITH kebab-case IS NOT SUPPORTED !!!

      e.g. <the-header />
    -->


    <!-- WE CAN IMPORT COMPONENTS LOCALLY TO APP.VUE 
    
    - This means that these components are NOT AVAILABLE IN OTHER COMPONENTS 

    -We do the following imports between the opening <script> </script> tag i.e. Above export default{}

    -We import the components using the following way:

      -import TheHeader from './components/TheHeader.vue';
      -import BadgeList from './components/BadgeList.vue';
      -import UserInfo from './components/UserInfo.vue';     
    -->



    <!-- REGISTERING COMPONENTS IN OUR DEFAULT CONFIGURATION OBJECT
    
    - We add components property which takes in an object

    - This takes in  key : value pairs with comma separated , between components

    -We can do this in multiple ways

      1.)    'the-header' :  TheHeader,     - key- kebab-case and value -PascalCase
      2.)   TheHeader :  TheHeader,  - PascalCase
      3.)   TheHeader                         ES6 - syntax if key/value matches you can remove the value


    -->


        <!-- STYLING ---
    
    - Styling added to App.vue needs to be Global if there is no scoped keyword

    -This means that the following styles are Global and will be used in all components

        <style>
            html {
              font-family: sans-serif;
            }

            body {
              margin: 0;
            }
        </style>

    - However <style scoped></style> with an attribute scoped means that they are only local to those components they have been defined

    -In short , it would be nice to scope this styles to just the components they are used in

    -Means that the styles will only affect the template in which you define them

    -This tells Vue that the styles defined there only affect the template that lives there

    -IF you inspect vue does this by giving them a specific ID

    e.g
            header[data-v-9a9f6144] {
                width: 100%;
                height: 5rem;
                display: flex;
                justify-content: center;
                align-items: center;
                background-color: #14005e;
                }
    -->


     <!-- DYNAMIC COMPONENTS ---

     -Vue has this concept of Dynamic components 

     -Let's say we are building a component that has various tabs/buttons we can press to show a different component 

     -i.e. In our case see Active goals / Manage goals

     -Normal cases , the scenario would look like this

        <active-goals v-if="selectedComponent === 'active-goals'"></active-goals>
        <manage-goals v-if="selectedComponent === 'manage-goals'"></manage-goals>

    -But this looks redundant because we have to set if conditions on each component and as your app grows, there will be a lot of repetition

    -This is where dynamic content comes into play

    -Vue offers a special HTML element which you can use - <component></component>

    -Cannot work on its own and therefore needs a :is="" property

    -The :is="" property tells component which component of all the components you define should be shown in place of this component

    -We bind :is="" dynamically  to active-goals

        <component :is="active-goals"></component>

        -But of course we dont want to hard code this because if we di we could have just used 

          <active-goals></active-goals>

      -Instead what we wanna do here , is to bind :is="" and then point to the selectedComponent which holds our component HTML tags as values

      -It's 'active-goals initially , but we have a method that switches between active-goals and manage-goals which are our component tags

      -And that we are telling Vue that the component should swap itself for either active-goals OR manage-goals i.e. Whatever that is currently stored in the selectedComponent

        <component :is="selectedComponent"></component>

      -And by doing that we have less code and avoided use of multiple if-statement for each component

       <active-goals v-if="selectedComponent === 'active-goals'"></active-goals>
       <manage-goals v-if="selectedComponent === 'manage-goals'"></manage-goals>
